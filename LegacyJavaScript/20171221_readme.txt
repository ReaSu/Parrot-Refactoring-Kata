JavaScript Classic with Eclipse (Node Tools).

* 32 minutes. Slow.
* Had to google for inheritance in prorotypes. Took some time.
* Had to change original function code to inheritance code first. Took some time.
* Tests run in Eclipse console because we just run Mocha with switches helps.
  Did not think of watch switch. Maybe even better...

* All methods and fields are public, easy to push down. (like ES6)
* Extra arguments to functions (and less arguments) do not matter unless used. (like ES6)
* Prototype inheritance is less nice than ES6 `extends` and `super`.
