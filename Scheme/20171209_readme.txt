Parrot kata in Scheme using Gambit in Ultra Edit.

* 78' + 10' - 22' = 66' ~ 1h
  (looked at it 10' before committing start tag, 22' break)
* simulating class with new and send works, but seems not Scheme style.
  I would rather leave the functions alone.
* The polymorphy and super construct works. Not sure it is nice/readable.
* Small steps work as well.
