Clojure with VIm/UED

* long time no kata here. Clojure and Scala were pending. 
  Probably because Scala is slow and I do not know Clojure as well.
* Setup is easy with Lein.
* Switched to Ued soon after Start with VIM.
* Autotest is cool in other window.

* Time = 45' + 50' = ~ 1.5h
* Was fighting with Multimethod long (1h5')
  Problem was that core and test were in different state.
* 12 Steps: 4 delegationg Multimethods, 
            4 Method Bodies, 
            2 Extract Methods, 
            Delete original Method, 
            Sort Methods.
* Felt easy, just 30'
