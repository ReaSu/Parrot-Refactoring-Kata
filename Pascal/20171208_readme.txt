Parrot kata in Turbo Pascal using original TURBO 6.0 editor.

* 58' that is long.
* stupid mistake with type of pointer after first change took a lot of time.
* fought with constructor chaining (did not know how).
* mainly used copy/paste as code completion
* worked out well. Starting code is sufficient for the kata.
* TP has no private fields, methods, much like Python.
  So I omitted some steps because not needed.
* TP omits () for methods with no arguments, much like Ruby.
  So it is not clear if I use a field or a method. But who cares?
