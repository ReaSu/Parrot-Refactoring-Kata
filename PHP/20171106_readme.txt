Try again in PHP with Eclipse. Cool that I have almost all environments ready here.

* 20 minutes. Slower again...
* Constructors are inherited. Makes it easier.
* Mixing push down with change of constructor signatures. Bad?
* Did not create ctor for EuropeanParrot because know I will delete it again.
  But maybe I should. Finish each class one by one. No coming back to it.
* Works as expected. No Refactorings in Eclipse, but not needed.
