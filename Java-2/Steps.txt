Steps
-----

1 empty EuropeanParrot used in tests
2 copy speed
3 removed code from parent speed
4 reduced constructor in tests
5 removed European from types

6 empty AfricanParrot used in tests
7 copy speed
8 removed code from parent speed (not done alone)
9 push down _loadfactor
10 push down/copy whole constructor
11 reduced constructor in tests
12 removed African from types

13 empty NorwegianBlue used in tests 
14 copy speed
15 removed code from parent speed (not done alone)
16 push down _compute_base_speed_for_voltage
16 use self._voltage in _compute_base_speed_for_voltage
17 push down/copy whole constructor
18 reduced constructor in tests
19 removed NorwegianBlue from types, delete types

20 remove base constructor (not done alone)
21 remove empty European constructor

22 remove braces in min (_compute_base_speed_for_voltage) in Norwegian
23 extract _slowdown_due_coconuts in African
24 rename _compute_base_speed_for_voltage to _speed_for_voltage in Norwegian
25 extract _max_speed in Norwegian
