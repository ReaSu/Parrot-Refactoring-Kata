Steps
-----

1 empty EuropeanParrot used in tests
2 copy speed
3 removed code from parent speed
4 reduced constructor in tests
5 removed European from types

6 empty AfricanParrot used in tests
7 copy speed
8 removed code from parent speed (not done alone)
9 push down _loadfactor
10 push down/copy whole constructor
11 reduced constructor in tests
12 removed African from types

13 empty NorwegianBlue used in tests 
14 copy speed
15 removed code from parent speed (not done alone)
16 push down _compute_base_speed_for_voltage
17 use self._voltage in _compute_base_speed_for_voltage
18 push down/copy whole constructor
19 reduced constructor in tests
20 removed NorwegianBlue from types

21 remove base constructor (not done alone)
   delete types
22 remove empty European constructor

23 remove braces in min (_compute_base_speed_for_voltage) in Norwegian
24 extract _slowdown_due_coconuts in African
25 rename _compute_base_speed_for_voltage to _speed_for_voltage in Norwegian
26 extract _max_speed in Norwegian
