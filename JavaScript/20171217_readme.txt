JavaScript ES2015 with UltraEdit.

* Ultimate IDEA not available.
* uses (unknown) testing framework Jest
  * takes 120' for first run. weird, maybe because of no Internet?
  * has load of dependencies: 193 MB! (570 MB on disk)
  * `node_modules\.bin\jest --verbose --watchAll`

* 15 minutes. Not bad, it felt much slower.
* Tests run with --watch in second window is nice,
  faster than manually running them.
  but when both files need to be saved at the same time, I get red bar (shortly).
* Constructors are inherited. Makes it easier.
* All fields and methods are public, easy to push down.
* Extra arguments to functions (and less arguments) do not matter unless used.
* Works as expected. No Refactorings in UED, but not needed.
  Only Push down would be needed, but that is just cut/paste in same file.
* It took some time due unknown API of `extends` and `super`.
